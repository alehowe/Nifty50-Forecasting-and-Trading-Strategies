# Guidelines

The aim of this work is to forecast the NIFTY 50 index and develop trading strategies. We integrate established econometric frameworks with cutting-edge deep learning models to generate forecasts for the NIFTY50 index and convert these insights into practical trading tactics.

In-depth explanations of the research questions, methodologies and results can be found in the [report](https://github.com/alehowe/Nifty50-Forecasting-and-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Report_Nifty50ForecastingAndTradingStrategies.pdf).
A concise overview and key takeaways are available in the [presentation slides](https://github.com/alehowe/Nifty50-Forecasting-and-Trading-Strategies/blob/main/Presentation_Nifty50ForecastingAndTradingStrategies.pdf).
